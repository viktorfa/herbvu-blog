HerbVu collects quite a lot of interesting data. This can be used to make easily readable charts that give us some
insight into pricing, nutrition, difference between stores etc. 
Some great people have made free and easy to use tools for plotting visualizing data. For this I'm using a 
library [plotly](https://plot.ly) that lets both programmers and more casual users make beautiful charts with
data from sources such as Excel or a database.

The first plot is a price comparison of different sweeteners out there. The very sweet sweeteners that are many times
sweeter than sugar are excluded, as they are priced quite differently because of their potency.

We can see that sugar is the cheapest normal sweetener, but the alternatives are not too far behind on price. Note that 
the sugar here is quite exclusive and expensive compared to the much cheaper one you would find in regular stores.
Manuka honey is definitely the costliest. Is the taste really worth it?

This one plots the amount of protein versus the amount of calories in various protein bars. The variaty is quite
staggering, so you better watch out the next time you buy bars.
