I had just moved into my first student dormitory and was super excited about being able to have control over every facet of my everyday life, including my cooking and what I ate. I knew I needed to stock up on normal groceries like spices, pasta, flour, sauces and since I was leading a healthy life - stevia! Being on my tight student's budget, I was looking for the very cheapest of the cheapest for all of this. Daily reading about grocery sales, travelling far to buy spices at the Turkish shop, and crunching numbers from iHerb to find which product of stevia gave me most bang for the bucks. 
Having just started studying computer science, I quickly figured that me sitting with a calculator dividing price by package quantity of dozens of products was a completely redundant task. All information is there freely available on iHerb's website, and some clever programming can automatically decide which package of stevia you should buy, and show you how much you actually save. Not only would it work for stevia, but for pretty much any product out there. 

First, I just made a simple site I used once in a blue moon for personal use. As the semesters until my graduation got fewer and I became better at making websites, I figured this might be something that could be popular with the general public. 
I have a dream of being able to live off income generated from my own projects, and iHerb's affiliate program would allow HerbVu to help me achieve this if it were to be successful.

I've spent a lot of time and learned a lot in the progress of making this site. I'm glad I did it whether it turns out to generate any money or not. I'm still using it myself when I want to compare prices between products.
