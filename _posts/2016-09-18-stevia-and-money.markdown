As with most trendy products, prices vary wildly for the same product when you're shopping for stevia. Some shops charge more than others, and manufacturers package the goods differently to charge more for less.
Different packaging can be practical, but with a little discipline and knowledge, it will be so much cheaper to avoid sugar in your cooking.

One of the reasons why there is so much sugar in processed foods, is that it's dirt cheap as a sweetener and as a filler. The others being that it's so commonly used with a long tradtion and has a taste most of us likes. It's unfortunate that [sugar probably is one of the greatest health hazards in our diet](http://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/apr/07/the-sugar-conspiracy-robert-lustig-john-yudkin/), so let's see how it can be replaced in your home cooking.

Let's take Bob who has always sweetened his tea with sugar, but after reading about diabetes and having paid a hefty dentist's bill, he decides to use stevia instead.

Bob uses 2 tea spoons of sugar in each cup of tea and drinks two cups daily. Over a year that adds up to 2 * 2 * 365 = 1460 tea spoons, which is equivalent to 6,1kg, giving his poor body 24000 empty calories extra. That's the same as 12 days of fasting or 16 pounds of Ben and Jerry's cookie dough ice cream.
When Bob makes the change to stevia, he needs about 36 grams or 7 tea spoons of pure stevia powder extract, or alternatively, 72 grams (15 tea spoons) of liquid stevia extract, to replace the entire year's sugar consumption. One single drop of liquid stevia extract would give the [same sweetness as two tea spoons of sugar](http://www.herbvu.com/sweetener-converter).

[Buying the stevia online](http://www.herbvu.com/main/stevia-powder) would only put him back about seven bucks and he'd still have more stevia for next year, while the price of the sugar is about $5. This means that, for Bob, sugar is actually the more expensive option, even without considering the costs for fixing cavities and, God forbid, diabetes medicines. His teeth are also better looking and his new, slender frame makes him a hit among the ladies.
